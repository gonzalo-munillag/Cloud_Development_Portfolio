# Capstone Project: 

Without docker:

cd into folder 
npm install 
node app.js

Then use your browser to visit localhost:3000
 
It will ask you for a login, you should enter exactly: for email "user@email.com" and for password "password"

Then the website will take you to a page to enter a date

You can choose a date

Future dev:
You can make modifications in app.js 
You can add a new page to render the data if you like

WIth docker:

run on the directory where this file is contained
docker-compose -f docker-compose-build.yaml build --parallel
